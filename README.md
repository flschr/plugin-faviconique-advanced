## Do you enjoy Faviconique? I'd love your support!

Hey! It's me, Sven. Faviconique and my other plug-ins are passion projects released to the world for free. That said, donations are always welcome if you get value from my work.

[💸 Donate $10](https://dahlstrand.net/donate/) or any amount you're comfortable with. Thanks! 🙏

## Bells and whistles

* 🟦 Solid color favicons
* 🦖 Emoji favicons (with an optional solid background color)
* 🌙 Dark mode support

## Get started

This plug-in is available in the official directory and should be easy to install.

### Install the plug-in

1. Find [Faviconique in the plug-in directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/140).
2. Choose the site you want to install the plug-in to.
3. Press *Install*.
4. Congratulations! The plug-in is installed.

### Customize your favicon

1. Go to *Plug-ins* and press ⚙️ *Settings* (next to the Faviconique plug-in).
2. Pick a *Background color*.
3. Type exactly one emoji into the *Emoji* text field.
4. Choose a *Dark mode background color* and *Dark mode emoji*.
5. Hit *Update Settings*.

Dark mode is optional. Uncheck *Enable dark mode, please* if you don't want it. *Use transparent background for emoji* does what it says on the tin.

### Go check out your new favicon

When the settings are to your liking, visit your blog to see your new favicon. It may take a while, a couple of minutes or so, before it shows up. If it doesn't show, try making a hard refresh and emptying your browser cache.

### Browser favicon support

Most browsers have full support for favicons, but there's one notable exception: Safari on Apple devices. People visiting your blog using Safari will always get a solid square with the color you've chosen.

| Browser 	| Solid color 	| Emoji 	| Dark mode 	|
|---------	|-------------	|-------	|-----------	|
| Firefox 	| ✅           	| ✅     	| ✅         	|
| Safari  	| ✅           	| ❌     	| ❌         	|
| Edge    	| ✅           	| ✅     	| ✅         	|
| Chrome  	| ✅           	| ✅     	| ✅         	|

See [my notes on Safari lacking SVG favicon support](https://dahlstrand.net/december-adventure/#day-6) if you're interested in the technical details.
